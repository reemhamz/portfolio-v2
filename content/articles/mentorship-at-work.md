## Do over-competitive atmospheres reduce mentorship opportunities?

I've been working in the tech industry for about four years now, and something I've always felt lacking in the industry is quality mentorship.
\
\
Now, I'm not talking about mentorship from one of your peers, friends, or an aquaintance you met at a networking event one time. I'm speaking about mentorship in the workplace. 
\
\
### What is the point of mentorship?
I get it, I've worked in companies where I had to train new junior employees or interns, and I see how they would ask simple and repetitive questions that would be a Google Search away from an answer. I can see how it could be annoying.
\
\
Although, mentorship isn't necessarily about answering all these random questions. Mentorship could be about helping somebody new to the team have a good onboarding experience, where a mentor would walk the new developer through git processes, code structures, git repositories, and the company's scrum schedule and expectations.
\
\
Helping juniors or new employees learn the ropes of how the company operates could help them understand much of the engineering culture in the comnpany without being too overwhelmed (and we all know how every engineering team has their own biases and structures).
\
\
Mentorship could also be scheduling one-on-one meetings on a weekly basis to check in with your new developer, and have a platform to allow both parties to ask questions in an open and safe space, without judgement about intelligence.
\
\
Most importantly, in my opinion, is having the chance to pair-program together. This would help a junior developer see how a senior developer thinks in the middle of programming an application, and how they would work around some of the logic. Giving a junior exposure to such elements would direct them on the right path of writing more efficient and consistent code throughout projects.
\
\
### Compromise leads to neglect.

No matter how much we speak about mentorship in interviews, or letting the company know I value mentorship more than other aspects, most seem to neglect it once I start the job, leaving me stunted in my web development growth and knowledge.
\
\
This unfortunately happens to a good percentage of developers starting out. Many juniors often get overlooked and forgotten about. It causes a severe problem to many developers who are trying to find their footing, learn or tweak their skills, and grow in the field. 
\
\
This leads to an atmosphere where you constantly feel like you need to prove yourself in order for the senior developers to deem you "worthy" of working alongside them, or to be assigned tasks and challenges. You may work towards that *worth* by over-exerting pressure on yourself, internalizing your questions and concerns, or burning out. However, it all *really* takes you down one avenue: **Imposter Syndrome** Ave.
\
\

### Imposter syndrome isn't to be embraced
Imposter syndrome is when somebody feels they aren't as competent in the field as they made themselves out to be. This is less to do with how a person may work, but more about how well they're working or getting sh*t done.
\
\
I've had my fair share of days where my imposter syndrome would kick me down when stuck on a problem or when I could not understand a concept my seniors deemed as simple. I often thought *"How much longer do I need to prove myself?"*. It would get so toxic in my head that I would dread going into work the next day, because I genuinely felt less intelligent than others around me, it's a crappy feeling at best.
\
\
This isn't something to embrace, and every developer I have really spoken to about this topic has admitted they also suffer from imposter syndrome regularly in their career. The only way we can really be better is if we disallow it to consume us. This is not a very manageable task, as much as we say it is.
\
\
Now, I'm not throwing shade here to senior developers, but I'd like to dive into what may be the root cause of such neglect. 
\
\

### Is it the company or the senior developers?

Developers can fall into the common stereotype of being too quiet and introverted, however with remote work times have changed and folks have been encouraged heavily to be part of a team culture and include others. If they fail to do so, it can definitely put a strain on teams of any structure.
\
\
Nowadays, collaboration and teamwork is more important than ever, **especially** during a global pandemic, where work is remote. Companies are interviewing now, they would ask if the candidate is comfortable working from home, or if they're not so adjusted yet. It's important to gage the candidate to see if they *fit* into the new environment.
\
\
Cool, now the current workers are encouraged to communicate better, and recruiters have made sure the new candidates can fit a WFH structure. But... now what?
\
\
#### Short-term business goals & lack of time management
You may have heard of scrum meetings/agile methodology, which means teams work in (usually) two-week long sprints, and should be able to complete their assigned tasks witin the timeframe. Developers often shift their focus during this time to complete their short-term task at hand, rather than be encouraged to create long-term goals.
\
\
[Coreteam.io](https://coreteam.io/the-broken-state-of-software-developer-mentorship/) said it best in their article,

> *This means that developers push teaching (helping other developers) and learning (re-writing your code) aside to a lower priority. Even when teaching and learning do happen, I’ve found many junior or mid developers to be less open to feedback or re-factoring of their code. They’re more set on wrapping up their work and moving on to the next priority.*

Uh-oh. There's that root cause.
\
\
I've had personal experience that **perfectly** aligns with what was said above. My previous company just couldn't justify adding more time and resources for senior developers to mentor the juniors, eventually leading them to not add me to project sprints, with the reason of me not being experienced enough. Much of the stress and trauma could have been avoided in my scenario if the company wanted to allocate the resources necessary to train. Instead, they bought me Udemy courses and didn't care to do much else.
\
\
#### Manager is not aligned with the team
A fellow [Juno](https://junocollege.com/) alumni of mine (who shall remain anonymous), mentioned how his engineering manager does not know how to code. He was assigned the managerial role with no understanding of how things are done under the hood. This would create plenty of problems for the engineering team.
\
\
For one, since his manager was not familiar with coding, he had bad expectations of project completion dates. This lead to much of the team working overtime and on weekends with no overtime pay, and a lower quality of work, because the team did not have proper mentorship and guidance of how to move forward.
\
\
My fellow alumni has been working at this company for over three years, yet unfortunately admitted to me that his growth and development in the industry has been stunted due to poor leadership.
\
\
If developers have no guidance and no educated manager to turn to, how could they improve their skills? How would they know the feedback they're receiving is well-justified? There are many questions in this particular situation, it's definitely a tough one.
\
\
However, the toughest one to crack, in my opinion, is ego.
\
\
#### Developer ego, on all levels
As I mentioned above, many developers are not as social as the role requires them to be. Senior developers that have been in companies for years already feel as if they have tenure, and are not very open to changing their communication style if it does not benefit them.
\
\
I'm sure it is not easy to ask them to change in their tenure-like positions. As companies grow and teams shift, juniors **will** come into play, and companies should be encouraging senior employees of any team to be open to teach, or answer some questions, without reluctancy.
\
\
However, it isn't only the senior developers who have ego. Even junior developers fall trap to their ego, in many cases because they are trying to prove themselves so they do not ask too many questions, or they've learned that asking for help doesn't always lead to getting the proper guidance you need (re: lack of proper mentorship).
\
\
There are plenty of reasons why ego gets in the way of any developer, but we need to start talking about ways in the industry on how to avoid the pride that goes into our work and our collaboration with peers, as it will eventually stunt everyone's growth.
\
\
### Is it really over-competitive?
You may be asking: *"Where is the over competitiveness she mentioned?"*. It's everywhere.
\
\
From companies implementing agile sprints that lead to ...
\
\
Everyone only prioritizing assigned tickets, which leads to ...
\
\
Senior developers not having much time to speak to or be there for junior developers,  which leads ...
\
\
Junior developers to realize they aren't receiving the time and guidance they need, forcing them into a position of over-exertion, self-induced pressure, and internalizing questions and concerns, finally resulting in ...
\
\
A stressful working environment, imposter syndrome, and junior developers who feel as if they are stagnating rather than growing, AKA *burnout*.
\
\
### Final thoughts
I don't want to take away from senior developers, I am 100% sure they experience stress in their very own ways, some of which I don't understand quite yet as I am not at that level.
\
\
However, junior developers need to be made well-aware that mentorship is not something to compromise in their first few years in the industry.
\
\
Sure, developers are encouraged to take on challenges and work on their own, something I also abide by (I've learned plenty on my own, and it won't stop anytime soon), but they shouldn't be encouraged to compromise on learning from experts who work alongside them.
\
\
With remote work being an inevitable part of our future, companies need to invest into ways to improve mentorship opportunities, as it would lead to less turnover from junior developers, and will create a stronger community that is proud to be part of the company culture.
